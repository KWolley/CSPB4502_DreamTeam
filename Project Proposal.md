# Problem Statement/motivation 

UFO sightings across the Globe has been a highly controversial topic for over a century.  Main stream media rarely publishes possible sightings for fear of ridicule while individuals that report a sighting are often cast out from popular society.  This primary purpose of this will be to create a visual representation of UFO sightings that is easy to interpret by users, compile useful summary statistics, and gain new perspective for the authors.  The projected questions to be answered through this project include the following:
1)	Are sightings consistent in geographical space and time?
2)	Does the shape or duration of the sightings change with geographical position?
3)	XXX

A secondary goal of this project is to integrate election data with the UFO data.  Election data are collected by the  MIT Election Data and Science Lab and published in 2018.   This data integration aims to answer the following questions:
1)	Is there a correlation between UFO sightings and dominating political party in the county
2)	XXX

# Proposed Work
The aim of this report is to apply all phases of the knowledge discovery process to UFO sighting data collected by the National UFO Reporting Center.  Methods used by the knowledge discovery process include, data cleaning, integration, selection, transformation, mining, evaluation and knowledge presentation.  Primary data include sightings from the last century across the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia.  Additional integration of data will include county presidential election results from the year 200-2016, if time permits.  

## E.g., what do you need to do for data collection, preprocessing (cleaning,

For the primary data set, UFO sightings, a single source will be used from the National UFO Reporting Center as published in 2019.  The following tasks must be performed for this data set prior to use. 
1)	Data must be cleaned to remove random errors which can be identified through data sorting methods.  Cleaning will also include the analysis of missing values.  Missing values, or nulls, must be identified and handled appropriately.
2)	Data integration will occur if the project has remaining time to introduce electoral data.  This integration will be done with additional cleaning.
 

## Describe how it is different than what has been done previously from your literature survey (or if replicating).
Previous work aimed to address geographical, season and visual characterizations of UFO sightings.  Some of this project will repeat the work previously done.  Additional work will be performed to address XXX.
Additionally, if time allows, novel research will be done by integrating electoral data by county.
