## Team members:

3)Kara Wolley
4)Sam Cramer
## Description: 
This project will analyze the occurance, location and prevalence of UFO sightings in the United States in the last century.  Our work will address the following questions:
1) Which cities have the highest prevalence in sightings
2) Are the shape of the sighting dependent on the duration?
3) Are sightings with similar shape or duration more prevalent in certain cities?
4) How does UFO prevalence impact _________________


## Prior Work: 
The dataset was first explored by Shelby in preliminary research.  To date only minimal data cleaning has been completed, for example identifying what data is missig or prevalence of outliers in the data. Although this dataset contains enough data for interesting results, it may be combined with other datasets, such as election data.  
##Datasets:

### List of datasets to use
Data is foundi in csv files
### Where found (URL and who is supplying the data, e.g., NASA)
Data can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings
data is compiled on Kaggle by an independent user
### Whether it you have it downloaded (on whoâ€™s machine)
Currently, the data is downloaded on Kara's maching and has been added to the github repository.
## Proposed work: what do you need to do?
### Data cleaning:
Identify missing data/ nulls and or values that cannot be parsed
Identify outliers or erroneous data
### Data preprocessing:

### Data integration:
## List of tool(s) you intend to use
tools that will be used throughout this analysis include
1) MATLAB
2) PYTHON

## Evaluation: How you can evaluate your results
