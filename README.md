## Description: 
This project analyzed the occurance, location and prevalence of UFO sightings in the United States in the last century. For further analysis we will also see if there are any correlations with UFO sightings and US general elections.

## Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers: 
1) How does term number effect the number of UFO sightings? Is this also dependent on the political party? ANSWER: Term length does not appear to effect the number of UFO sightings.
2) Are UFO sightings increasing over time? ANSWER: Yes, they are increasing over time. 
3) If UFO sightings do increase over time, how is that correlated with the turn out rate for elections? ANSWER: UFO sightings are increasing over time and there is a correlation with an increase in total votes cast in each election. 
4) In states that vote Republican are there more or less UFO sightings? ANSWER: In Republican voting states there are fewer UFO sightings, Democratic voting states have an average of 3 sightings for ever 2 there are in a Republican voting state. 


## Application of this knowledge: 
Our project can be used to understand the trends in UFO sightings over the last century such as the frequency of sightings, how the language used to describe them has changed, and when sightings are most likely to occur. On top of this, it shows how UFO sightings have correlated with other world events, like elections and their turnouts during the last half century.
